### Hi, I'm Jason Dai

I originally fell in love with coding through highschool developing interesting games using Python (Pygame) and Java (Android Studio), and want to continue to bring unique and enjoyable experiences to others through the software I contribute.\
I am currently expanding my knowledge of HTML/CSS, Javascript, and React to leverage in my web development journey with the goal of producing tools and games that are easily accessibly through the internet, and want to continue to bring unique and enjoyable experiences to others through everything I create.\
I'm currently on the lookout for roles in software development and engineering, ideally for a company focused on user-facing products.\
If you're hiring, let's chat!
