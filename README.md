### Hi, I'm Jason Dai

I originally fell in love with coding through highschool developing interesting games using Python (Pygame) and Java (Android Studio), and want to continue to bring unique and enjoyable experiences to others through the software I contribute.\
I am currently learning HTML/CSS and Javascript web development to produce tools and games that are accessibly through the internet.\
I'm currently on the lookout for roles in software development, ideally for a company focused on user-facing products.\
If you're hiring, let's chat!
